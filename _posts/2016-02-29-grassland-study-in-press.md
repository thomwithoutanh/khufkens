My latest paper titled <strong>"Productivity of North American grasslands is increased under future climate scenarios despite rising aridity"</strong>, in Nature Climate Change, is finally online. After 1.5 year of work I'm rather pleased to see it "in press" !

The short version of the paper reads:
<ol>
	<li>Grasses will adapt to a more arid world by shifting their growing season</li>
	<li>This leads, counter-intuitively, to a slight increase in ecosystem productivity</li>
	<li>However, at the same time this puts rangeland managers at a disadvantage due to this more variable growing season.</li>
</ol>
You can read the full version <a href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2942.html">HERE</a> if you have access to the Nature publishing group content. Alternatively, you can find a full copy on <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ9tX4qKLLAhWCdT4KHQ6EChsQFggdMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fprofile%2FKoen_Hufkens&amp;usg=AFQjCNGNKzM9jOTCAa4zspCx0gEmkSjqaA&amp;sig2=NqLy9JtAhNEHJUhMmkoiJg">Research Gate</a> (or email me).
