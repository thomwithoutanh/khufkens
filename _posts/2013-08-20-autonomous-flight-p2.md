To the right, the flight plan of my latest UAV flight. I programmed the UAV to fly in a pattern across the local field where I fly. A manual take-off used, then switching to waypoint (auto) mode. The UAV returned to launch nicely, hovering at 15m until manual take over and landing.

I couldn't properly attach my normal point and shoot for photos or video during the flight so I'm looking into buying a GoPro like camera for this purpose.
