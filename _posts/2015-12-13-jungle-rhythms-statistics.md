First of all, hooray... the first subject in my project retired!!!

Furthermore, in order to track the progress of the project without downloading all classifications I wrote a little web scraper in R which grabs the summary statistics such as:
<ul>
	<li># registered users</li>
	<li># classifications</li>
	<li># subjects (images to classify)</li>
	<li>retired subjects (these are finished)</li>
</ul>
I <a href="http://www.khufkens.com/2015/12/21/scraping-zooniverse-statistics/">grab these statistics</a> on a half hourly basis to track progress of the project over time. Every day I make a summary graph of these results. This summary graph can be found on the <a href="http://junglerhythms.org/#stats">Jungle Rhythms landing page</a> and below. In this graph I currently only plot the number of classified subjects over time, as well as the number of registered users.

This simple graph should give me an idea on the rate of progress of the project. Check in on a regular basis to see how things progress.
