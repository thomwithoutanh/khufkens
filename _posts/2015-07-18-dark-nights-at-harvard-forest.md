The past two days I was out at Harvard Forest to help collect samples for Morgan, a PhD student in the lab. I know the skies at Harvard Forest can be pretty dark so in addition to working boots I packed my camera and tripod. The result of some patience and an hour of post-processing can be seen below. In the picture's top left you see the Coathanger or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brocchi%27s_Cluster" rel="nofollow">Brocchi's cluster</a>. At bottom right Sagittarius and the galaxy's center sets into trees lining Prospect Hill road. On the bottom the Torrey Labs (left) and the Fisher house (right) and the trees on Prospect Hill road are lit up by street lights. The final picture is a stacked exposure of 10 shots at 25 sec. each with a 12mm / f2 lens at ISO 6400. (click for a full sized version)
