The [CLImate Smart Forestry in MOuntain Regions (CLIMO) COST action](http://climo.unimol.it/) focusses on adaptation to climate change through climate-smart forestry practices. The CLIMO COST action is currently looking for candidates for short term scientific missions (STSM). These missions have a focus on early career scientists who want to work within the context of the COST action.

In particular, [working group (WG) 3](http://climo.unimol.it/wgs/wgs-3/), which focuses on technological aspects of measuring forest processes, is looking for interested candidates to study wireless technology and sensor networks (e.g. temperature of the canopy, visual parameters through phenocams, etc) as well as physiological aspects of forests disturbances such as (persistent) droughts using stable isotope or other dendrochronological measurements. There are also opportunities to work with existing data within the context of data visualization and development of web-based tools to monitor canopy phenology responses to climate change. Different topics within the framework of WG3 are also welcome. Candidates will work out of INRA Bordeaux under guidance of Dr. Lisa Wingate (WG3 lead) and myself.

Currently there are two calls in 2017 (see below) with the deadline for the first call approaching fast. Apply while you still can !!

### Calls for 2017

- First STSM call submission deadline: 24, July 2017
  - call opens: 24, June 2017
- Second STSM call submission deadline: 15, October 2017
  - call opens: 15, September 2017

## Application procedure
Full details on the application procedure can be found on [the STSM webpage of the CLIMO COST action](http://climo.unimol.it/networking/stsms/).
