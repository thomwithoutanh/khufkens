Past January, after 10 years of service, the battery bank of the Bartlett flux tower gave in to too many cycles and harsh working conditions. Since it is a key component of the flux tower, replacements were bought and a large part of the lab made a trip to Bartlett to carry 6 large deep cycle batteries into the New Hampshire woods. Below the rather funny video of me sledding a battery into the woods. After a day of work, things are back up and running and have been ever since, hopefully for another 10 years.
