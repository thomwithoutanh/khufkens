<blockquote>A cache of decaying notebooks found in a crumbling Congo research station has provided unexpected evidence with which to help solve a crucial puzzle â€“ predicting how vegetation will respond to climate change. . . . (by Dan Grossman)</blockquote>
My Jungle Rhythms has made some waves as of late. The project sparked the interest of dr. Dan Grossman, a science journalist, and his nice summary of all the Jungle Rhythms work was published in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/22/long-lost-congo-notebooks-shed-light-how-trees-react-to-climate-change">The Guardian</a>. As a result of this IFLscience <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/environment/newly-discovered-1930s-congo-notebooks-could-help-us-understand-how-trees-respond-to-climate-change/">picked it up as well</a>. Especially in the comments section of The Guardian the response was really positive. I'm happy to see some global exposure of the project, and the larger context and importance of similar work. I also hope that this exposure might bring about more funding to safeguard historical collections and capacity building within this context in DR Congo.
