I'm starting a new series of blog posts called Harvard 360 (a bit of my life and research on the Harvard campus). I'll be posting 360 immersive pictures to provide a real feel for my work around Harvard University, and in particular during field work.

I kick off the series with an image ofÂ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Yard">Harvard Yard</a>. Harvard Yard houses the oldest buildings on campus as well as all undergraduate housing and several libraries. In front of the white building in the distance is the statue of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvard_%28statue%29">John Harvard</a>.
