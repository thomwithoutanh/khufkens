Recently the raspberry pi foundation released <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-8-megapixel-camera-board-sale-25/">a new iteration of their camera</a>, version 2 (v2). This camera is based upon a different chipset compared to the previous version, namely Sony's IMX219 (8MP). Luckily the specs were easier to find. So, <a href="http://www.khufkens.com/2015/11/02/ov5647-spectral-response/">once more</a> I digitized the spectral response curves from the spec sheets.

You can find both spectral response curves of v1 and v2 pi cameras in my <a href="https://khufkens.github.io/pi-camera-response-curves">github repository</a>. An example image of the response curves for the new Sony IMX219 chipset is shown below.
