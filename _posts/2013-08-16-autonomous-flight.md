Here is a small map of a waypoint mission I flew two days ago. Although giving control to the autopilot does give you some sweaty palms the ardupilot performed wonderfully. I'm rather sad I neglected my work on the UAV so long. Part of it was having limited access to a nice and safe area to fly over. I'm now closer to a tram stop that takes me out of town so flying is more convenient and less of a hassle. More experimenting, especially with flying gridded layouts will follow.
