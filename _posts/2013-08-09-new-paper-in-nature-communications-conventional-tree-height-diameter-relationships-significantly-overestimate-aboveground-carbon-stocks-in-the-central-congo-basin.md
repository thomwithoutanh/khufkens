The Nature Communications paper that was recently accepted and on which I contributed can be downloaded from the Nature website! (<a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2013/130805/ncomms3269/full/ncomms3269.html">http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2013/130805/ncomms3269/full/ncomms3269.html</a>). Congrats to all co-authors on pushing this along.

Another paper with Simon Lewis as lead author was also recently published. They used some of the our data to quantify above ground biomass for 260 plots across tropical africa (<a href="http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/368/1625/20120295.short">http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/368/1625/20120295.short</a>).
