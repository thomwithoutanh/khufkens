Yesterday I updated my laptop from Ubuntu 12.04 LTS to the<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop"> latest release 14.04 LTS (Trusty Thar).</a> Overall the experience is very pleasant. I noticed that the interface is snappier, bootup is as fast (It's difficult to notice any differences on a fast SSD drive). What I did not like was the removal of some functionality in the file manager, mainly splitting the file manager window into two columns. This has been a sore point for many users but there are work arounds of it really messes with your workflow. I'll give it a try and go without for a while. Also some of my favourite themes don't work anymore. I now use the <a href="http://numixproject.org/">Numix theme</a> as a subsitute.

I also did some counting and I figured out that I've spend most of my research career (approaching 10 years) using Ubuntu, starting with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ubuntu_releases">their first release 4.10 (warty warthog)</a>. More so, aside from some graphics work for which I used a Mac I've been only using Linux for research and day to day needs, and never regretted making this move. With Ubuntu moving into tablet territory I foresee some exciting times in the linux (open-source) community.
