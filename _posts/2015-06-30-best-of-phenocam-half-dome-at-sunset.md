Another PhenoCam gem! Half Dome rises almost 3000m above sea level at the eastern end of the Yosemite national park. The western side lights up in the evening sun. That's a lot of magnificent granite in the evening sun. Recently Google documented the ascent of another famous rockface in Yosemite, El Capitan, using their street view project. It makes for <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/06/vertical-street-view-of-worlds-most.html">a good read </a>and some sweaty palms if you are not so comfortable with heights.
