In a previous post I mentioned my efforts to standardize and consolidate the IMS and CMC snow products. In order to keep the ball rolling on development of the code I created a new bitbucket project.

You can find the link to the projectÂ on my software page. I will add new functions to process the data on a later date. If I find the space I will also upload the consolidated data, if not ask them to be hosted by NSIDC. As of now the code will allow you to compile the data in stacked geotiffs yourself. Happy hacking everyone.
