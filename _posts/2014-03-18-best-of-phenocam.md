As I wander through the <a title="PhenoCam gallery" href="http://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/gallery/" target="_blank">PhenoCam archives</a>, I encounter truly stunning or interesting images. From time to time I'll post these "best of PhenoCam" images on my blog together with some location information.

This first image is an old one, posted to my Flickr site a long time ago. It shows an early sunrise at a boreal Jack pine (<em>Pinus banksiana</em>) forest roughly 30 km south of Chibougamau, Quebec, Canada. Jack pines form fire adapted stands of 9-22 m tall and lanky trees. The image was taken from a <a title="Chibougamou flux site" href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/mges-ghgm/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=063998A5-1" target="_blank">30 m high scaffolding tower</a> harbouring an eddy covariance flux system.
