Red foliage is often associated with autumn. Yet the same pigments, anthocyanin, which makes for spectacular leaf peeping in autumn is also present during spring, although short lived and more subtle.

However, although still debated, it's two primary functions are the same during both seasons, mainly photo-inhibition and a visual deterrent for herbivores. The colour red seems to repel aphids and at the same time it absorbs excessive incoming light which might damage the fragile photosynthetic machinery of a young leaf. As the leaves mature they lose their red tint as more chlorophyll starts to make up the bulk of the leaf pigments. This is what is illustrated in the attached image series. More interesting literature on the topic is listed below.
