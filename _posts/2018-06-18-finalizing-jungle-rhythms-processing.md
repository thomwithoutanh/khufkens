In the run-up to the [ATBC 2018 meeting](http://atbc2018.org/) I've finally sat down and crunched through the final processing of the Jungle Rhythms dataset. I can now accurately convert all the citizen science annotations to coordinates on a grid and finally, estimates of tropical tree phenology. In total, while omitting 'empty' years, the project now has gathered phenology observations of 16417 site years of data, across 1237 species.

Below you see the annotations converted to dates for the tree species *Millettia laurentii*. This includes 11 specimen tracked across 8-years. More detailed analysis on the causes of tree mortality, and the timing of various processes (flowering, fruiting) will follow after the ATBC 2018 meeting.
