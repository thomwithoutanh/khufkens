After a nice write up on my <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/22/long-lost-congo-notebooks-shed-light-how-trees-react-to-climate-change">Jungle Rhythms project in The Guardian</a> a more <a href="https://ensia.com/features/congo-rainforest/">lengthy write up </a>of other projects in and around the Yangambi research station, both in the past and ongoing,Â  is now online on ENSIA.com. Good to once more bring some attention to safeguard local historical collections and capacity building within this context in DR Congo.
