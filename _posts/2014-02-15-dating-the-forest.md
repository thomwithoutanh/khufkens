Determining stand ages in a tropical humid forests remains a challenge, mainly due to the lack of (annual) growth rings in the wood of many tropical trees. A few months ago I was offered the opportunity to date wood core samples using radio carbon dating at the UC Irvine Keck Carbon AMS facilities, resolving the issue of a lack of visible characteristics to determine the age of a tree. I'm indebted to Prof. dr. Trumbore for providing this generous offer as these tests are expensive.

Three samples along a wood core for two tropical humid forest species were selected. One species consisted of a dominant canopy species <em>Scorodophleus zenkeri</em> and a common mid-sized / understory species <em>Panda oleosa</em>.

Only the  youngest of the three samples for each species was valuable in this exercise. Other samples fell within a region which is hard to date using radio carbon dating as the calibration curve for this region is relatively flat (~1700 - 1950) resulting in large uncertainties when relating 14C-age to calendar years (see examples Figure 1).

Example 2 shows multiple possible calendar years matching a given 14C-age, complicating accurate dating (courtesy of Utrecht University)[/caption]

Although the data is limited to two data points per species, the first being the time at which the wood core sample was extracted and a second the dated sample as determined by radio carbon dating, we could get a rough estimate of the growth rates for both species during the last few decades.

Ages of the most recent samples were determined to be 1962 / 1985 and 1966 translating into growth speeds of~0.8 / 1.3 mm/yr and 0.7 mm/yr for <em>Scorodophleus zenkeri</em> and <em>Panda oleosa</em> respectively. These values fall well within the ranges as defined by literature but on the lower end of the range.

The slow growth rate of <em>Panda oleosa</em> is not surprise as it is often light limited, being a mid-sized species. The stature of these understory trees pales in comparison to emergent trees such as <em>Petersianthus macrocarpus </em>(Figure 2), their age however might not. Take home message: don't judge a tree's age by it's stature.
