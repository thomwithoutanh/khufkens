Over the summer I created the <a href="http://virtualforest.io">Virtual Forest project</a>. The aim of the Virtual Forest project is to immersively track the seasons using 360 photography and time lapse movies (once enough data is collected) of a <a href="http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/">forest in the North Eastern US</a>.

You can track the season in a regular browser, or on a mobile device supporting gyroscope feedback. For a complete immersive experience Virtual Forest supports <a href="https://vr.google.com/cardboard/">Google Cardboard</a> and <a href="https://www.samsung.com/GearVR">Samsung GearVR</a>. Additional support for VR headsets such as the <a href="https://www.vive.com/">HTC Vive</a> and <a href="https://www.oculus.com/">Oculus Rift</a> is provided through the <a href="https://aframe.io/">A-frame framework</a>.

The project gives everyone the experience of tracking the seasons in a North Eastern deciduous forest through tele-presence. It allows for leaf peeping from a distance and visualizes, otherwise slow, ecological processes using <a href="http://virtualforest.io/timelapse.html">timelapse movies</a>. The images gathered will also support research efforts in understanding the timing of changes to the canopy structure. Above all, I hope Virtual Forest will inspire people to venture outdoors and explore a forest in real life as Virtual Forest remains a proxy for what is a wonderful world.

UPDATE:

virtualforest.io got a nice feature on <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/virtual-forest">MotherBoard</a>!
