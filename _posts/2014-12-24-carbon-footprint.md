Living and working in Boston makes me fly a lot. I fly back home on a regular basis to visit family and friends. International conferences make me travel by air as well. This year I decided to offset all my flights to reduce my carbon footprint from flying and go CO2 neutral on this front.

Although offsetting my carbon footprint is not substitute for not accruing one in the first place this is the best what I can do as of now, given my work situation. I hope my actions might inspire other people to start thinking about their carbon footprint and how to offset it.

I offset my footprint using a Belgian company called <a href="http://www.co2logic.com">co2logic</a>, but other companies offer similar services.
