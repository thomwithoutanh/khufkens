This is a sneak preview of a project I'm working on with the acronym BULI. It's the first part designed in FreeCAD and designed to hold some electronics. The resulting enclosure will be milled from Delrin, a plastic with good mechanical properties. I have access to a shop, so it shouldn't take to transform this digital design in a real life piece. More pictures and sketches will follow.
