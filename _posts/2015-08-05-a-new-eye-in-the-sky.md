Today the latest EUMETSAT 4th Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite returned it's first image.  This is Europe’s latest geostationary weather satellite and the latest iteration in a long line of weather satellites going back to the mid the 1990's with the launch of the first generation Meteosat satellites. In our changing world it is key to keep a keen eye on weather and weather systems.

Below you find the first snapshot made by the satellite. Due to it's geostationary nature it captures the same location on the face of the planet but generally with a higher frequency than orbiting satellites, creating the cloud time lapse movies you find in your weather reports and weather websites.
