Given my experience in with data loggers and input/output (I/O) on various platforms such as Arduino's and Raspberry Pi's I was asked to put together a little workshop on data logging.

Although the Internet of Things (IoT) has reached the “Peak of Inflated Expectations” on <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2819918" target="_blank">the Gartner Hype Cycle</a>, I still believe in the usefulness of internet connected platforms. Given this notion, I decided to order a <a href="https://store.particle.io/?product=particle-photon">Photon</a> from Particle. The Photon is basically a simple System on a Chip (SoC) with wifi capabilities and I/O connections - put differently, a very small computer. The specifications outperform those of the more general SoC solutions such as the trusty ESP8266 platform, more so it provides a nice web interface over which you can deploy your code, bypassing some nasty interface issues. The latter was the main reason to go this route rather than the ESP8266 direction (although slightly cheaper).

Details aside, the electronics came in the mail today and I look forward to piecing something together and logging some data by the time I will give the actual workshop at the beginning of November. Once completed I'll put the full workshop online.
