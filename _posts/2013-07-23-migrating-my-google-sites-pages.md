I'm finally migrating my old google sites blog to a more pleasing wordpress layout. Most of the data (downloads) will be migrated to the new site, old post on my google sites blog will be partially copied to populate my otherwise rather empty (at first) new blog. Older posts will remain on the old blog. I plan to rewrite some of my short tutorials (bash / GRASS / R scripts) in pages on this blog or blogposts. As such I will not copy these either.
