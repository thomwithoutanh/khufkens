A recent review comment made the claim that Citizen Science (referring to my <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/khufkens/jungle-rhythms">Jungle Rhythms project</a>) is exploitative. With due diligence on part of researchers, not only is this comment <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.2925">misguided</a>, it also is a testament to a pervasive ivory tower way of thinking about science.

Science is often perceived as a field of the select few with limited interaction between the scientific world and the public. Or as aptly put in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2017/jan/25/alternative-facts-experts-scientists-fight-alone-humanities?CMP=twt_a-science_b-gdnscience">Guardian Science section</a>: "Science is the invisible profession. Most people have no idea what scientists do, and may harbour a vague feeling of suspicion or uneasiness about the whole endeavour."

This lack of transparency has been abused many times over to create doubt and confusion in order to push a political agenda, <a href="http://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/">fueling among others climate skepticism</a>. In addition, a lack in transparency and limited communications creates a less educated public and one which is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2017/jan/27/a-crisis-of-trust-is-looming-between-scientists-and-society-its-time-to-talk?CMP=twt_a-science_b-gdnscience">less used to dealing with complexity</a>.

Citizen science provides a way to counter all these issues. It allows citizens to actively contribute to science, directly communicate with scientists and at times attain PhD worthy knowledge through self-study. In today's society with increasing distrust in science through fake news and "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/us/politics/president-trump-inauguration-crowd-white-house.html">alternative</a>" facts this direct and transparent communication about science between scientists or science communicators and the public <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2017/jan/27/a-crisis-of-trust-is-looming-between-scientists-and-society-its-time-to-talk?CMP=twt_a-science_b-gdnscience">is key to retain or restore trust in science</a>.
