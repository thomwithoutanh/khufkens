I haven't made much noise about this but the grassland study I submitted to Nature Climate Change was accepted. I'm working on the final edits to resubmit after Christmas. I'm rather happy with this outcome. For more details I suggest to keep an eye on the Nature Climate Change portal. I will discuss the work in detail after the press moratorium.

With the upcoming data paper, presenting an extensive dataset of curated PhenoCam data, there might be enough data to do more grassland related work as many grassland sites were added, where I was rather data limited before.
