After scoring a little talk at AGU but having to bail as the chemical analysis wasn't finished in time I can pick up where I left and present my results at EGU.Â  I'll present my work titled "Multi-decadal carbon and water relations of African tropical humid forests: a tree-ring stable isotope analysis" at Session IG5/CL5.15/SSP4.2, room G13 on Wednesday, 10 Apr 2013, 10:45.

Furthermore, I put some pictures and videos online of the last field campaign. Photos can be found on my personal <a href="http://flic.kr/s/aHsjEuwQTE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Flickr page</a> and the videos on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/COBIMFO">COBIMFO YouTube channel</a>. Enjoy!
