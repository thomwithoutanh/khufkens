After an amazingly short ~475 days the <a href="http://junglerhythms.org/">Jungle Rhythms citizen science projec</a>t finished !

I hereby would like to thank all citizen scientists who contributed to the project and made it into a success, transcribing ~30K site years of tropical phenology data in no time.

I will now start the post-processing. I will report on this shortly as I make my way through the large dataset consisting of more than 300K classifications and additional remarks collected from the Talk forums. <a href="http://www.khufkens.com/2016/06/15/jungle-rhythms-time-series-accuracy-and-analysis/">Intermediate results </a>have shown that the data collected are of an outstanding quality, illustrating the swift and accurate work by citizen scientists. I'm confident the complete dataset will be of an equal high quality.

Once more, my thanks and gratitude go out to all volunteers who made this possible !
