    As an earth system scientist and ecologist I model ecosystem processes, such as vegetation growth or drought / disturbance resistance, using various -retrospective- proxy measurements in a model data fusion approach, including among others remote sensing, dendrochronology and recovered historical data records.

    Throughout my career I worked interdisciplinary borrowing heavily from fields, outside of ecology, such as image vision processing (computer science), remote sensing and engineering to assist in either field measurements and/or model driven analysis.
